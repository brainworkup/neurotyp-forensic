          Reading ability encompasses three interconnected skills: _Decoding_,
          which is the capacity to identify and pronounce isolated written
          words; _Comprehension_, the aptitude to understand explicit facts in
          the text as well as infer unstated aspects; and _Fluency_, the
          proficiency in swiftly and fluently decoding and understanding basic
          written information.
