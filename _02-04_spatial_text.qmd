Biggie demonstrates a mix of average abilities in visuospatial processing.

- **Perception**: Average perceptual processing, discrimination, and pattern matching requiring close attention to visual detail.

- **Reasoning**: Average inductive reasoning and nonverbal problem-solving.

- **Construction**: Constructing and recreating abstract visual designs was Average.

- **Organization**: Copying of a complex figure requiring visuospatial
integration, planning and organization, and efficient encoding of visuospatial
material was Low Average. This indicates executive function difficulties in planning and
organizing complex visuospatial material.
