Biggie demonstrated a range of performance across different memory tasks.

### Learning vs. Recall

- **Learning Efficiency**: High average performance in learning and immediate recognition of visual material (abstract shapes). Low average performance in complex one-trial verbal learning (story learning).

- **Delayed Recall**: Average performance in recalling verbal lists after a delay with cues and in recognizing visual material after a delay. Notable weaknesses in the delayed recall of complex verbal and visual material.

### Verbal Memory

- **Rote Memory (List Learning)**: Average abilities in both learning and recalling lists of information after short and long delays, suggesting adequate rote memory skills.

- **Contextual Memory (Story Memory)**: Low average abilities in learning and recalling story details immediately. Continued low average abilities in recalling story details over time, indicating difficulties with contextual memory.

### Visual Memory

- **Figure Recall**: Below Average performance in spontaneously recalling and
reproducing a complex abstract figure after a long-term delay, suggesting
difficulties with visual memory retention secondary to
deficits in the initial planning and organization of the material.

- **Immediate Recognition**: High average capabilities in learning and recognizing abstract shapes immediately.

- **Delayed Recognition**: Average abilities in recognizing target visual material among distractors after a delay.
