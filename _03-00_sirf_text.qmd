## Overall Evaluation Interpretation

{{< var first_name >}} {{< var last_name >}} is a {{< var age >}}-year-old {{< var handedness >}}-handed {{< var sex >}} with a history of {{< var dx1 >}}, {{< var dx2 >}}, and {{< var dx3 >}} who was referred for neuropsychological testing as part of a comprehensive work-up for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. General cognitive ability is well within normal limits, and there is no evidence of decline from premorbid estimates. No deficits were detected in the domains of attention, processing speed, motor functioning, or visuospatial skills. Although many aspects of executive functioning, language functioning, and memory were within normal limits, {{< var he_she >}} demonstrated mildly inefficient problem solving and hypothesis testing, weaknesses in word retrieval, and inefficiency in new learning of verbal information. There is no evidence of a mood disorder at this time.

In conclusion, the cognitive profile is mildly localizing and lateralizing as there are elements that suggest relative left temporal involvement. That said, there were features seen during testing that suggested mild frontal systems disruption as well. Although Biggie lives alone, {{< var he_she >}} has arranged to have {{< var his_her >}} mother stay with {{< var his_her >}} for a week or two after surgery to help {{< var his_her >}} and provide support in the immediate post-acute period. {{< var he_she_cap >}} seems to have a good understanding of and appropriate expectations for the surgery. Taken together with {{< var his_her >}} current asymptomatic mood profile, there are no obvious psychological risk factors for a poor outcome or need for presurgical mental health intervention.
