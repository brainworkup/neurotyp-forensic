## Reason for Referral

Hak Wong is a 68-year-old Asian-American physician referred for evaluation. On
August 19, 2022 he was involved in a property dispute with construction workers
at his home in Malibu, CA. Escalating tension led to Dr. Wong displaying a
firearm in a defensive reaction, perceiving a threat to his personal safety, as
the individual with whom he was in the dispute was reportedly confrontational,
"twice his size," and almost 20 years younger. The LA County Sheriff's Department
arrested Dr. Wong and charged him with one felony count of assault
with a firearm (Penal Code 245(a)(2)).

Dr. Wong underwent a comprehensive psychological and personality evaluation
(12/21/2022) conducted by Jennifer Bosch, Psy.D. Results indicated (1) he was
not at risk for engaging in future violence, and (2) he suffered from major
depressive disorder. The current evaluation was requested to update the court on
Dr. Wong's mental health status in relation to his arrest.

## Background

Dr. Wong has no prior criminal record and does not use drugs or alcohol. His medical/psychiatric history is marked by significant episodes of major depression, anxiety, and trauma. These conditions have been exacerbated by a series of traumatic events, including a severe automobile accident during his medical school years. This accident led to the amputation of his right leg below the knee and necessitated the use of a prosthetic limb. In 2018, Dr. Wong experienced a left-sided cerebral hemorrhagic stroke, which has had ongoing effects on his mobility, cognitive abilities, and emotional regulation. His colleague and business partner of 26 years at his medical practice in El Segundo, CA expressed concern about a potential diagnosis of bipolar disorder and declined to continue their professional partnership due to perceived risks to patient safety following Dr. Wong's stroke. More recently, Dr. Wong has been facing additional stressors in the form of property management issues, tenant conflicts, and personal safety concerns.

Dr. Wong's initiation into firearm ownership can be traced back to the
self-defense measures he adopted during the civil unrest/riots following the
Rodney King incident in Los Angeles in the early 1990s. Media representation at the time
depicted many individuals and business proprietors in Korea Town as having to
independently safeguard themselves and their enterprises, often with firearms.
Born in Hong Kong to parents who later immigrated to the US, Dr. Wong was not
fully versed in the nuances of US firearm regulations. This led him to believe
that firearm ownership was a commonplace practice and a necessary step for
personal protection. Consequently, he purchased a firearm which he stored
inconspicuously in his closet for over two decades. However, during the COVID-19
pandemic, he faced a threatening incident involving unauthorized occupants,
commonly referred to as "squatters," who pulled a gun on him in a home he owned
in the Hollywood Hills. This event prompted him to start carrying his firearm in
his vehicle for personal safety.

## Mental Status/Behavioral Observations

::: {.block above="1.2em"}
- **Orientation/Attention:** Alert, oriented, and memory intact but shows distractibility. Experiences short-term memory/attention issues (e.g., often spends 20+ minutes searching for his phone and keys), but denies major cognitive decline overall.
- **Appearance and Behavior:** Disheveled, rapid speech, fidgety, acknowledges need for mental health assistance.
- **Affect and Mood:** Reports stress and anxiety, exhibits severe mood swings,
from fleeting and instantaneous crying (multiple times during exam) to instantaneous and
inappropriate laughing (also multiple times). Denies suicidal and homicidal ideation.
- **Thought Process:** Rapid, unrelated thoughts; no delusions or hallucinations.
- **Speech/Language:** Pressured, disorganized, and difficult to understand at
times. Mathematical analysis indicated Dr. Wong spoke 81% of the time during our
2+ hour exam, whereas I only spoke 19% of the time.
- **Insight and Judgment:** Shows insight into condition, improved but
previously poor judgment. Utilizes meditative activities, such as tending
plants, as coping mechanisms.

## Summary/Impression

The actions leading to the arrest were atypical for Dr. Wong and appears
influenced by heightened anxiety, complex life stressors, and historical
traumatic experiences, rather than any predisposition towards aggression. His
action to display a firearm under threat suggests a lapse in judgment
rather than aggressive or impulsive behavior. He struggles with emotional
distress, especially related to health and family matters, indicating chronic
mood concerns.

Dr. Wong meets DSM-5 criteria for conditions directly impacting cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral functioning, contributing to the incident. He expresses fear of being perceived as aggressive, emphasizing that his actions
were motivated by fear and anxiety rather than anger. He has participated in
anger management, demonstrating awareness of his need to regulate his emotional
responses. Further, Dr. Wong's stroke history impacts his mobility and potentially his
sense of vulnerability. He reflects on familial and cultural influences affecting his
perceptions and decisions around self-defense.

The current follow-up evaluation underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to Dr. Wong's mental health and cognitive concerns. It highlights the importance of considering his cultural background, language barriers, and the complex interplay of trauma, stress, and both manic- and depressive-like emotions in his life. Dr. Wong is recommended for the Mental Health Diversion Program to address these multifaceted aspects, supporting his recovery and enhancing his quality of life. With adherence to a recommended treatment plan, his prognosis is favorable for mental health diversion, offering significant benefits in addressing underlying mental health issues and reducing recidivism risk.

1. **Comprehensive Neuropsychological Evaluation**: A thorough assessment of the

4. **Physical Health Management**: Medical supervision for stroke impact and mobility issues.
5. **Community and Legal Support**: Assistance with property and legal issues to alleviate stress and anxiety.
6. **Family Reconciliation Efforts**: Encourage family therapy to reduce feelings of isolation.
7. **Cultural and Educational Outreach**: Education on legal self-defense mechanisms and fear and anxiety management consistent with cultural values.
