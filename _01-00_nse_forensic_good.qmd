## Reason for Referral

Biggie Smalls is a XX-year-old XX referred for evaluation. The LA County Sheriff's Department
arrested Mr.  Smalls and charged him with one felony count of X (Penal Code X).

## Background

Mr.  Smalls has no prior criminal record and does not use drugs or alcohol. His medical/psychiatric history is marked by significant episodes of major depression, anxiety, and trauma. These conditions have been exacerbated by a series of traumatic events, including a severe automobile accident during his medical school years. This accident led to the amputation of his right leg below the knee and necessitated the use of a prosthetic limb. In 2018, Mr.  Smalls experienced a left-sided cerebral hemorrhagic stroke, which has had ongoing effects on his mobility, cognitive abilities, and emotional regulation. His colleague and business partner of 26 years at his medical practice in <<CITY>> expressed concern about a potential diagnosis of bipolar disorder and declined to continue their professional partnership due to perceived risks to patient safety following Mr.  Smalls's stroke. More recently, Mr.  Smalls has been facing additional stressors in the form of property management issues, tenant conflicts, and personal safety concerns.

## Summary/Impression

The actions leading to the arrest were atypical for Mr.  Smalls and appears
influenced by heightened anxiety, complex life stressors, and historical
traumatic experiences, rather than any predisposition towards aggression. His
action to display a firearm under threat suggests a lapse in judgment
rather than aggressive or impulsive behavior. He struggles with emotional
distress, especially related to health and family matters, indicating chronic
mood concerns.

Mr.  Smalls meets DSM-5 criteria for conditions directly impacting cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral functioning, contributing to the incident. He expresses fear of being perceived as aggressive, emphasizing that his actions
were motivated by fear and anxiety rather than anger. He has participated in
anger management, demonstrating awareness of his need to regulate his emotional
responses. Further, Mr.  Smalls's stroke history impacts his mobility and potentially his
sense of vulnerability. He reflects on familial and cultural influences affecting his
perceptions and decisions around self-defense.

The current follow-up evaluation underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to Mr.  Smalls's mental health and cognitive concerns. It highlights the importance of considering his cultural background, language barriers, and the complex interplay of trauma, stress, and both manic- and depressive-like emotions in his life. Mr.  Smalls is recommended for the Mental Health Diversion Program to address these multifaceted aspects, supporting his recovery and enhancing his quality of life. With adherence to a recommended treatment plan, his prognosis is favorable for mental health diversion, offering significant benefits in addressing underlying mental health issues and reducing recidivism risk.
