<<PROMPT>>

## Area: Sensorimotor Functions (Gross Motor and Fine Motor)

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area
denoted above. For scores that are Below
Average, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily
functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that
are Exceptionally High/Above Average to Exceptionally Low/Below Average to
delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended
additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall
Below Average to Exceptionally Low.

Prefix the output/results as follows: Headers (e.g., Relative Strengths,
Relative Weaknesses) should be padded with ###, and output that contains lists should be
unordered and padded with - instead of ordered.

<<EXAMPLE>>

All scores in this area were Average. Fine motor speed and dexterity were
Average bilaterally. No evidence of atypical lateralization of fine nor gross
motor skills. No evidence of dyspraxia. Graphomotor speed and accuracy (i.e.,
graphomotor control) was intact. Gross motor functioning including balance and
gait appeared intact on observation.

<<START>>

Assessment of graphomotor speed (time only) was Above Average.
Nondominant hand dexterity was Average.
Fine-motor dexterity (dominant hand) was Average.
Assessment of graphomotor speed and accuracy (combined) was Low Average overall.
Assessment of graphomotor control/accuracy (i.e., errors made) was Low Average.
