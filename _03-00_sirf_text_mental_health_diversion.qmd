## Overall Evaluation Interpretation

Daniel Estey-Ang is a 36-year-old, right-handed male referred for neurocognitive examination as part of a comprehensive work-up for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
General cognitive ability is well within normal limits, and there is no evidence of decline from premorbid estimates.
No deficits were detected in the domains of academic achievement, language functioning, or visuospatial skills.
Judgment and decision-making are Above Average on exam.
Importantly, he performed Above Average on a simulated driving test measuring several aspects of visual attention thought to be important for driving ability [@Brown2005ACN].[^corr]
Although learning and memory were within normal limits, he demonstrated inefficiency in new learning of detailed vs. rote verbal information.
The executive functions of attention and processing speed are Exceptionally Low and result in significant functional impairment as described in greater detail below.

Parent reports identified many ADHD symptoms and functional impairment, including hyperactivity, inattention, and working memory issues, along with self-esteem concerns.
Further, deficits in daily executive functioning were reported in areas such as emotion regulation, inhibitory control, planning, flexibility, and organization.

Self-reports of ADHD and real-world executive functioning indicate severe impairments, suggesting widespread cognitive, emotional, and behavioral deficits.
His combined presentation of ADHD is reflected in his notable ADHD-related challenges, including inattention, memory problems, hyperactivity, restlessness, impulsivity, and emotional instability.

Mr. Estey-Ang's health concerns, rooted in his Type 1 childhood-onset diabetes diagnosis, significantly impact his social interactions and relationships, leading to substantial distress.
He also exhibits significant depressive symptoms, specific fears, anxiety, history of panic attacks, and certain phobic behaviors.
His impulsivity and desire for excitement seem to pose challenges to his interpersonal relationships and occupational functioning, possibly exacerbating his ADHD symptoms.

## Mental Health Diversion: Contextual Analysis and Interpretation

The remaining findings will be described in the context of the criteria for California's Mental Health Diversion program.

### 1. Does the defendant suffer from any mental disorders as identified in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)?

Yes, the defendant meets the criteria for three psychiatric disorders as defined by DSM-5.

**(1) Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (314.01)**

Mr. Estey-Ang exhibits pervasive and longstanding ADHD symptoms and impairment,
with related impairments in aspects of executive functioning. Ongoing difficulties include:

- Attention/concentration

- Task completion

- Forgetfulness

- Poor organization

- Difficulties with social relationships

- Low self-esteem and self-confidence

Moreover, he struggles with impulse control, strategic planning, distraction avoidance, and self-evaluation.
His flexibility and organization skills are impaired, affecting his adaptability and time management.
His behavioral reports align with the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD-Combined
Presentation, and his neuropsychological profile and psychosocial history are consistent with this diagnosis.

**(2) Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder -- Processing Speed (799.59)**

The defendant has marked impairments in *processing speed* above and beyond what
is predicted from ADHD alone. As shown above in **Figure 1** and **Figure 9**, there is an
extreme disconnect between his otherwise average-to-above-average higher-level
reasoning abilities and his Exceptionally Low processing speed and
attentional fluency. Impairments in attentional fluency (an underlying aspect of processing speed) are indicative of significant difficulty in the following areas:

- Rapidly shifting between tasks.

- Maintaining focus on complex activities that require regulation of attention.

- Difficulties in planning ahead and executing actions, controlling impulses, and coordinating movements.

- Negatively impact one's efficiency in multitasking and activities that demand quick and precise physical reactions.

The observed pattern of deficits in his neurocognitive profile aligns with the DSM-5 diagnosis of Unspecified Neurocognitive
Disorder.

**(3) Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (293.84)**

The current findings and the defendant's psychosocial history indicate child-onset Type 1 Diabetes has lead to Mr. Estey-Ang developing over time what is termed an "Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition," coded as 293.84 in the DSM-5.
This diagnosis is given when anxiety symptoms are a direct physiological consequence of a medical condition.
Type 1 Diabetes, particularly when managed from childhood, involves continuous
and stressful management that often contributes to the development of an
anxiety disorder.
This ongoing burden can significantly affect an individual's mental health
through multiple mechanisms, as it has his:

1. **Chronic Stress and Anxiety:** The daily demands of managing blood sugar levels, administering insulin, diet monitoring, and the fear of potential acute and long-term complications can be a constant source of stress and worry, which is a risk factor for both anxiety and depression.

2. **Physiological Fluctuations:** Significant fluctuations in blood glucose levels can affect mood and cause symptoms that might mimic or trigger anxiety, such as palpitations, trembling, or a sense of dread.

3. **Biological Factors:** Fluctuations in blood glucose levels can affect
cognitive function, potentially contributing to the development of depressive
and anxiety symptoms and exacerbating attention problems.

4. **Fear of Hypoglycemia:** Individuals with T1D may develop a specific fear related to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), which can be acute and potentially life-threatening. This fear can lead to constant vigilance and worry about keeping blood sugar levels in check.

5. **Impact on Social and Personal Life:** Managing a chronic illness like diabetes can affect schooling, social activities, and relationships, leading to feelings of being different, isolated, or burdened, which can contribute to anxiety. Young adults with diabetes often feel different from their peers due to their disease management responsibilities, leading to feelings of isolation and resentment, which further exacerbates mental health issues.

6. **Healthcare Encounters:** Frequent doctor visits, hospitalizations, or medical emergencies related to diabetes can be traumatic or stressful, further contributing to anxiety.

7. **Fear of Complications:** Worry about the long-term complications associated with diabetes, such as heart disease, neuropathy, or kidney damage, can contribute to anxiety.

The chronic nature of the disease, the need for continual management, and the
potential complications make it a significant risk factor for developing an
anxiety disorder. This impression is consistent with Mr. Estey-Ang's medical
history, psychosocial history, and the symptomatology he endorses.

### 2. Were any mental disorders a motivating, causal, or contributing factor to the defendant’s involvement in the commission of the offense?

Yes. Contributing, if not causal.

Even though driving is a ubiquitous functionality and an important activity
of independent daily living, it also represents a complex neurobehavioral task
involving an interplay of cognitive, motor, perceptual, and visuospatial skills [@putraAdultAttentiondeficitHyperactivity2023].
As a result, patients with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD often have
limitations in such skills.

An extensive field of research has indicated that
adults with ADHD are more likely than other adults to:

- Have had their drivers license suspended or revoked.

- Been cited for driving without a valid drivers license.

- Crashed while driving.

- Been at fault in such a crash.

- Been cited for speeding and even reckless driving.

Even more problematic than the higher rates of driving incidents among adults
with ADHD is the frequency and magnitude at which they
occur relative to adults without ADHD [@barkleyTakingChargeAdult2010]:

- An average of 3 times more license suspension revocations.

- 50% more crashes

- Nearly 3 times more speeding tickets.

- More than twice as many accidents in which they were at fault.

- More than twice as many speeding tickets and total citations on their DMV record.

- And more than twice as many reckless driving citations.

Of note, these results have been replicated in
different settings with driving self-reports, observational findings, driving
simulators, and DMV data.

### 3. If any mental disorders were significant factors in the commission of the offense, would the defendant’s symptoms of those mental disorders respond to treatment?

Yes. The defendant's symptoms of ADHD and anxiety disorder would respond to
treatment.

Treatment with stimulant medication has been shown to improve ADHD symptoms
significantly, which can correspondingly reduce the likelihood of driving
accidents when patients adhere to their prescribed regimen. Evidence supporting
this includes a Swedish population study demonstrating that male ADHD patients
on ADHD medication had significantly fewer traffic crashes [@wettermarkSwedishADHD2007]. Further research in the United States
corroborates these findings; a 2017 study involving over 2 million ADHD patients
revealed that males had a 38% reduced risk of motor vehicle collisions during
months when they were medicated compared to non-medicated periods [@chang2017adhd]. This study
also suggests that consistent medication use could potentially have prevented
about one-fifth (22%) of the traffic accidents among the studied ADHD patients.

### 4. Does the defendant agree to comply with treatment as a condition of diversion?

Yes, the defendant agreed to comply with treatment as a condition of diversion.

### 5. Would the defendant pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety (under the meaning of California Penal Code 1001.36), if treated in the community?

The defendant would not pose “an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” under the meaning of California Penal Code 1001.36, if treated in the community.
