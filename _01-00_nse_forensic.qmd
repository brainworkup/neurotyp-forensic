### Developmental/Medical History

Biggie was born full-term with no reported complications during pregnancy or delivery. His early development included some notable features: bed-wetting beyond typical age (with no identified medical cause), difficulties with frustration tolerance when learning new physical skills, and early motor coordination issues described as appearing "a bit floppy when he ran or was active," which reportedly improved during his high school years.

His medical history includes mild asthma (more significant in childhood), an appendectomy, allergy to Mesquite trees, and vision impairment for which he was prescribed contacts but does not wear them. Biggie experienced a fever above 104° at age 13. He was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary school and prescribed medication, which he refused due to disliking "the feeling." He is currently unmedicated and has no history of psychological counseling or psychiatric evaluation. Biggie is right-handed for all activities and typically visits a physician approximately twice yearly, with his last medical visit approximately one year ago.

### Behavioral/Emotional/Social

Biggie is described as having "a big heart," being "fun to be with," and "very social." He demonstrates leadership qualities in peer group interactions but exhibits significant behavioral challenges, including reactive anger when challenged or insulted and a history of fighting when provoked. According to reports, "Most of the time, it is not he who causes the issue, but he is quick to fight if challenged." He associates with peers who reportedly use illegal drugs and alcohol.

Behaviorally, Biggie exhibits overstimulation in play, a short attention span consistent with his ADHD diagnosis, and emotional withholding (difficulty expressing affection and feelings). His interests center around football, boxing, and video games, particularly online gaming with friends. There has been no recent decline in his participation in preferred activities.

### Family History

Biggie currently resides with his father in an apartment, where he has lived for the past 1.5 years. His parents separated when he was an infant. His mother, NAME, is unemployed with some college education. His father, NAME, is a self-employed executive who completed 11th grade. Biggie has no siblings.

While reportedly closer to his father, Biggie "has a good relationship with mom too." The father serves as the primary disciplinarian with a "more strict" approach, while the mother maintains "more of a friend style relationship." Discipline techniques include grounding and suspension of preferred activities, though Biggie "tends to listen with an attitude." Family activities include sports, conversations, and trips, with English as the primary language spoken at home. He sees his grandparents only a "Few Times a Year."

Significant family health history includes the father's intermittent stress-related hypertension and the mother's "problem with alcohol." Notably, both parents had ADHD, with the mother having taken Ritalin during her school years, suggesting a strong genetic component to Biggie's own ADHD diagnosis.

### Educational History

Biggie is currently in 10th grade at Home School, having transitioned from NAME High School by choice in 2024. His academic performance has improved in the homeschool setting, where he now earns mostly B's with one A. His educational history includes grade retention in elementary school and consistently performing below grade level on academic testing.

He has demonstrated specific difficulties with mathematics, described as being unable to "comprehend complicated, long math problems" and having "a hard time retaining information." Biggie has been evaluated for special education annually since 5th grade and currently has an active Individualized Education Program (IEP) with an ADHD diagnosis. His homeschool curriculum includes adaptations such as "business math instead of algebra." His anticipated graduation is in 2027.

While the father reports satisfaction with the current educational arrangement, he expresses concern about the lack of opportunity for school sports participation, which he believes "would have been very good for him" and might have prevented Biggie from associating with "kids that were trouble and not athletes."
