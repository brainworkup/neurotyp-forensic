## Area: Emotion/Personality and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI)

Summarize and interpret these neuropsychological test scores related to the area
denoted above. For scores that are Below
{ range }, give a brief example of how this could impact the patient's daily
functioning. Organize your summary and interpretation in order from scores that
are Exceptionally High/Above { range } to Exceptionally Low/Below { range } to
delineate relative strengths and weaknesses, respectively. Finally, recommended
additional support that the patient should receive in areas in which scores fall
Below { range } to Exceptionally Low.

Prefix the output/results as follows: Headers (e.g., Relative Strengths,
Relative Weaknesses) should be padded with ###, and output that contains lists should be
unordered and padded with - instead of ordered.

<<EXAMPLE>>

{{< var patient >}} completed an objective, self-report inventory of personality and emotional functioning. Given their scores on the validity scales, there are no problems with interpreting the clinical profile. They responded in an open and forthright manner, indicating only modestly elevated levels of stress and anxiety. They seem to have a positive self-image and are likely viewed by others as warm and friendly. There do not appear to be any contributing emotional factors that would account for their current cognitive difficulties.

On the clinical scales, {{< var patient >}}'s profile revealed no elevations above the
clinical skyline that would indicate the presence of clinical psychopathology in
the areas that are tapped by the individual clinical scales. Based on
interpretation of {{< var patient >}}'s scores, {{< var he_she >}} reported some preoccupation with physical
symptoms and bodily complaints (_elevated SOM-H_); it is possible that {{< var he_she >}} may
express {{< var his_her >}} psychological distress through somatic symptoms. {{< var patient >}} reported
high perceived stress, a great deal of tension, and having difficulty relaxing
(_elevated ANX-A_). {{< var he_she_cap >}} appears to have a tendency to be
impulsive and {{< var his_her >}} impulsive behaviors may interfere with interpersonal problems
and school functioning (_elevated BOR-S_). As a result of {{< var his_her >}} desire for
excitement and stimulation, {{< var patient >}} may often become easily bored by routine
activities (_elevated ANT-S_). Furthermore, {{< var patient >}}'s profile suggests {{< var he_she >}} tends
to be egocentric and have little regard for others. Although {{< var he_she >}} may feel guilt
over past misbehaviors, {{< var he_she >}} may feel little long-standing remorse (_elevated
ANT-E_). On the NON scales, {{< var patient >}}'s score suggests {{< var he_she >}} generally feels {{< var his_her >}}
family is a source of social support. However, {{< var he_she >}} may have few close
interpersonal relationships. Finally, {{< var patient >}}'s RXR score suggests {{< var he_she >}}
acknowledges the need to make changes and reports having a generally positive
attitude towards making personal change. Given the patient's diagnosis of ADHD
and Mood Disorder, the patient's personality profile appears to explain some of
{{< var his_her >}} classic symptoms such as concentration difficulties, stimulus seeking,
irritability, and impulsive behavior.
